2019 monash Data Science Project

#the DELWP project 
#it aims to generate a predictive model that allows volunteers to upload a new observation with the geographic information and categorise 
the new observation into high or low reliability. 
#Subsequently, the DELWP organization is intended to be provided with a table describing the importance of environmental variables.

#This product takes a constant format dataset as Input, and output a dataset with same format as Output
#See details in Code report, technique instruction part.

#The model we used is R built-in model, using Python, QGIS as filter and reformatting tools.

#The data source is from DEWLP project, Raster and VICmap-Lite data.

#To achieve the target outcomes, some steps in training are not based on coding or statistics, need some brief knowledges about this species.
#Interface is a little bit hard to use, need more improvement.
